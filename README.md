# VPNFilter
A PHP-based project to filter out VPNs from a Webpage using an API


PHP code that can be appeneded to any php page to redirect or block any user detected to be using a known VPN.

Note: API Keys are not included in this. While the first 500 checks with this API are free, I recommend purchasing an API from the host if you plan to use this for long term use. To recieve an api key, purchase an API key from http://xioax.com/


This code include various features such as in-built caching and notification to Slack.
Simply use a Slack webhook and replace the line in the code to enable Slack notifications.
